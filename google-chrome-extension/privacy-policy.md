# Privacy Policy for QR Code Reader Extension

**Last Updated: July 17, 2025**

Thank you for using the QR Code Reader Chrome Extension ("the extension"). This privacy policy outlines how we handle your data. Your privacy is important to us, and we are committed to protecting it.

## 1. Data Collection and Usage

The QR Code Reader extension is designed with your privacy as a top priority. It operates completely offline.

-   **No Personal Data Collection:** We do not collect, store, save, or transmit any of your personal data or personally identifiable information.
-   **Local Processing:** All QR code scanning and decoding happens locally on your computer within your browser. The image data from the QR codes you scan is processed on your device and is never sent to any external server or third party.
-   **No Tracking:** We do not track your browsing history, search queries, or any other online activity.

## 2. Permissions

The extension requests the following permissions in the Chrome browser to function correctly:

-   `contextMenus`: To add the "Open as URL," "View as Text," and "Copy as Text" options to the right-click context menu on images.
-   `activeTab` & `scripting`: To access the image you right-click on and execute the script that copies text to your clipboard.
-   `clipboardWrite`: To allow you to copy the decoded text from a QR code to your clipboard.
-   `host_permissions` (`<all_urls>`): To enable the context menu on images across all websites you visit. This permission is used solely to allow the extension to function on any page with a QR code image.

None of these permissions are used to collect data about you or your browsing habits.

## 3. External Websites

When you decode a QR code that contains a web address (URL) and choose the "Open as URL" option, your browser will navigate to that website. This action is initiated entirely by you. The extension does not control the privacy practices of external websites, and we recommend you review their privacy policies.

## 4. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
